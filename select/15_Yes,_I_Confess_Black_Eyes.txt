Day, I could not feel down anymore

One d-d-d-d-day

Taste of honey taste of salt

THIS KISS IS NOT A POISON
THIS KISS IS NOT A PRISON
Which position is strictly missionary
All pointing fingers and no rolling hips
You want to slip on the skin of suffering
You want to slip on the skin
You want to slip on the skin of suffering
You want to slip on my skin

Taste of honey taste of salt
At the base of your
Taste of honey taste of salt
Over the telephone line

I could taste
YOU!
One day, I could not feel down anymore

What makes your heart drop blood?
What makes your heart draw blood?
