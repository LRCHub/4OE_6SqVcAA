'Cause this music can put a human being in a trance like state
And deprive it for the sneaking feeling of existing
'Cause music is bigger than words and wider than pictures
If someone said that Mogwai are the stars I would not object
If the stars had a sound it would sound like this

The punishment for these solemn words can be hard
Can blood boil like this at the sound of a noisy tape that I've heard

I know one thing, on Saturday, the sky will
Crumble together (or something)
With a huge bang to fit into the cave
